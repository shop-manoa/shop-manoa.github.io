## Overview
The project, tentatively named "Shop-Manoa", aims to address the rapid turnover of goods and services among students at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM). The primary goal is to create an effective marketplace for campus-specific items, facilitating their recycling and reuse.

Shop-Manoa allows UHM students, faculty, and staff to buy and sell student-related goods and services. This platform is similar to Craigslist, with key differences including the requirement for UH credentials for all users, no anonymity, and the expectation of on-campus transactions.

## Features
* **Roles** (users, admin): users can buy or sell goods and services, while administrators monitor user behavior and manage categories and other functionalities.
* **Categories**: feature broad categories for goods and services.
* **Notifications**: users can opt to receive information via text message.
* **Alerts**: users can set up alerts for specific items they are looking for and will be automatically notified when such items are listed for sale.
* **Photos**: supports upload of photos.
* **Complaints**: users can report inappropriate content or users.
